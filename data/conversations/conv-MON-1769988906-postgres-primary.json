      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-primary (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe primary PostgreSQL database (postgres-primary) in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing critical performance degradation. Increased query execution times for SELECT statements on the products table have been detected, with a current average query time of 335.37 ms and 282 rows affected. This issue is likely due to database contention or inefficient query performance caused by high load on the connection pool, which currently has a size of 46. As a result, customers may experience delays in retrieving product information, leading to a degraded user experience and potential loss of sales. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: postgres-primary\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 335.37,\n  \"rows_affected\": 282,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 46\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate database performance metrics, optimize the query, and consider increasing the connection pool size or scaling the database resources to handle the load.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
