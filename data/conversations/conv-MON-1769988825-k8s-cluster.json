      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in k8s-cluster (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the k8s-cluster located in the ap-northeast-1 region. The cluster is experiencing high resource utilization, with CPU usage at 92.0% and memory usage at 96.95%. This is likely due to increased workload or insufficient resource allocation. The high resource constraints are affecting all workloads within the cluster, leading to degraded performance, increased latency, and potential service outages. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: k8s-cluster\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 92.0,\n  \"memory_percent\": 96.95,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 297.12,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 833.01\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up the resources allocated to the k8s-cluster. Additionally, investigate workload patterns to optimize resource usage. Customer notification is required due to the potential impact on service.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
