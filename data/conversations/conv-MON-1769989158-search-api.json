This impacts endpoints related to payments, users, products, and orders, resulting in customers receiving 429 (Too Many Requests) errors when accessing payment services. This may lead to failed transactions and user dissatisfaction. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: eu-west-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 661.63,\n  \"status_code\": 429,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 2.88\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the API rate limiting configuration and consider increasing the allowed request limits or optimizing backend processing to handle higher loads. Monitor for further anomalies.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
