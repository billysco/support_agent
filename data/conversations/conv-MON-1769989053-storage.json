      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in storage (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the storage service within the ap-northeast-1 region. The analysis indicates high resource utilization, with CPU usage at 90.89% and memory usage at 96.05%. This is likely due to increased load or inefficient resource allocation. The affected scope includes performance and availability of the storage service, leading to potential degraded performance, increased latency, or service outages for customers. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: storage\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 90.89,\n  \"memory_percent\": 96.05,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 317.04,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 678.26\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up resources or optimize workload distribution to reduce CPU and memory usage. Monitor resource metrics closely to ensure performance stability.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
