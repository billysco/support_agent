      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical frontend issue in mobile-app (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the mobile-app frontend in the ap-southeast-1 region. The error 'ReferenceError: fetchUser is not defined' indicates a missing or improperly referenced function in the code, likely due to recent deployments or code changes. This affects the user fetching feature, leading to page load failures. Customers are experiencing significant delays or failures in loading the mobile app, which may result in frustration and decreased user engagement. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: mobile-app\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 6968.78,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 584.59,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 37\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate recent code changes related to the fetchUser function. Roll back to a previous stable version if necessary and deploy a fix for the missing function. Notify customers about the issue and the steps being taken to resolve it.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
