The analysis indicates that high query execution times, averaging 396.32 ms, are likely caused by database locking or an inefficient query execution plan. This issue affects customers querying product counts, resulting in delayed responses and potential service degradation. The problem is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: postgres-primary\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 396.32,\n  \"rows_affected\": 580,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 46\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the execution plan for the query, optimize indexes on the 'products' table, and monitor database locks during peak times.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
