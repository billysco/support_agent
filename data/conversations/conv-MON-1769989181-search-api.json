This is likely due to an overload or misconfiguration within the service. The search functionality of the application is affected, preventing all users from performing searches. The issue is recurring, leading to a significant degradation of user experience and potential loss of customer engagement.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 577.89,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 7.15\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there are no effective workarounds. It is recommended to investigate the search-api service for performance bottlenecks or misconfigurations. Review recent changes and consider scaling resources or optimizing queries.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
