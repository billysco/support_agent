The DELETE operation is experiencing a high query execution time of 470.14 ms, indicating potential performance issues. This may be due to contention in the connection pool or inefficient query execution. The performance degradation is affecting session management, which could lead to session timeouts for customers. The connection pool size is currently set to 48, and this issue is recurring, necessitating immediate attention.\n\nService: redis-cache\nRegion: eu-west-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 470.14,\n  \"rows_affected\": 10,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 48\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the connection pool utilization and optimize the DELETE query. Consider increasing the connection pool size or implementing query optimization strategies. Monitor the performance closely and notify customers about potential delays in session management.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
