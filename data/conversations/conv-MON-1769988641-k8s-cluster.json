      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in k8s-cluster (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe k8s-cluster in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing critical resource constraints, with CPU utilization at 90.1% and memory utilization at 97.21%. This high resource utilization is likely due to increased workload or insufficient resource allocation. All workloads running within the cluster are affected, leading to potential service degradation or outages, increased latency, and reduced availability. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: k8s-cluster\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 90.1,\n  \"memory_percent\": 97.21,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 199.17,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 393.93\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale the k8s-cluster resources (CPU and memory) to alleviate resource constraints. Additionally, investigate workload patterns to optimize resource allocation.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
