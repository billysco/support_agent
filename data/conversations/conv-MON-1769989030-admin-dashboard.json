The error 'ReferenceError: fetchUser is not defined' indicates a missing or improperly defined function in the frontend code, likely due to recent code changes or deployments. This issue is causing page load failures, preventing customers from accessing the admin dashboard. The problem is recurring and has significant customer impact, potentially disrupting operations and eroding trust in the service.\n\nService: admin-dashboard\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 6808.95,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 248.05,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 40\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate recent code changes related to the fetchUser function. If necessary, roll back to a previous stable version of the admin-dashboard service and deploy a fix for the missing function.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
