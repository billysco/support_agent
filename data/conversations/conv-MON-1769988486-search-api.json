This is likely due to an overload or misconfiguration, affecting the search functionality for customers. As a result, customers are unable to perform searches, leading to potential loss of business and dissatisfaction. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 514.32,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 2.29\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there are no effective workarounds. It is recommended to investigate the search-api for performance bottlenecks, review recent changes, and consider scaling resources or optimizing queries.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
