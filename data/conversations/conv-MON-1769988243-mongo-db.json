      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in mongo-db (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the mongo-db service in the ap-southeast-1 region. The SELECT COUNT(*) query is experiencing high execution times, averaging 476.89 ms, which indicates potential performance issues. This is likely due to increased load or inefficient query execution plans. The affected scope includes database performance, leading to delays in data retrieval operations for customers, resulting in slower application response times and potential service unavailability. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: mongo-db\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 476.89,\n  \"rows_affected\": 46,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 46\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate database performance metrics, optimize the query execution plan, and consider scaling the database resources or increasing the connection pool size to handle the load. Customers should be notified about potential delays in service.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
