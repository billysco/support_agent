      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in search-api (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe search-api service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing critical issues due to a high volume of requests. This has resulted in rate limiting (HTTP 429) and server errors (HTTP 500), indicating potential overload or misconfiguration. Multiple endpoints, including login, users, products, and orders, are affected, leading to customer inability to log in and perform actions on the search-api. This disruption poses a risk of business loss. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 503.06,\n  \"status_code\": 429,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 3.55\n}\n\nWorkaround: Monitor traffic patterns and consider temporarily reducing the load on the search-api. Customers may try accessing the service during off-peak hours as a temporary measure while the root cause is being addressed.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
