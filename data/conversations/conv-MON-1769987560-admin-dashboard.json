      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical frontend issue in admin-dashboard (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the admin-dashboard service in the ap-southeast-1 region. The issue is related to a SecurityError indicating a potential problem with cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policies. This is likely caused by an iframe attempting to load content from a different origin that is blocked by the browser. The affected scope includes users trying to load pages that require cross-origin resources, leading to page load failures and disrupted access to admin dashboard functionalities. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: admin-dashboard\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 5138.3,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 772.75,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 31\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate and update CORS policies to allow the required origins or refactor the frontend to avoid cross-origin requests where possible. Monitor for further occurrences.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
