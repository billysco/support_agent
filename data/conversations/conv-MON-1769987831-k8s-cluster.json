      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in k8s-cluster (eu-west-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe k8s-cluster in the eu-west-1 region is experiencing critical resource constraints, with CPU utilization at 93.78% and memory utilization at 97.61%. This high resource utilization is likely due to an increased workload or insufficient resource allocation. As a result, all workloads running within the cluster are impacted, leading to degraded performance, increased latency, or potential service outages for customers. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: k8s-cluster\nRegion: eu-west-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 93.78,\n  \"memory_percent\": 97.61,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 141.01,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 743.92\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up resources for the k8s-cluster or optimize workloads to reduce CPU and memory usage. Additionally, investigate the cause of increased disk I/O (141.01 MBps) and network I/O (743.92 MBps) to further alleviate resource constraints.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
