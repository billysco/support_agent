      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-primary (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the primary PostgreSQL database service (postgres-primary) in the ap-northeast-1 region. The DELETE query on the 'sessions' table is taking longer than expected, with a query time of 390.46 ms and affecting 171 rows. This delay is likely due to a large number of rows being processed or potential locking issues in the database. As a result, session management is impacted, which may lead to delays in user login/logout functionality. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: postgres-primary\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 390.46,\n  \"rows_affected\": 171,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 47\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the execution plan of the DELETE query, optimize indexing on the 'sessions' table, and consider increasing the connection pool size from 47 if necessary.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
