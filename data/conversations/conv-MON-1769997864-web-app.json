Users are experiencing significant delays or failures in loading the application, likely due to a security policy that blocks cross-origin frames. This issue may stem from recent changes to the content security policy or third-party integrations. The load time has been recorded at 5503.24 ms with a bundle size of 520.22 kb and 14 resources loaded, indicating a severe impact on user experience.\n\nService: web-app\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 5503.24,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 520.22,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 14\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the content security policy settings and review any recent changes to third-party integrations that may affect frame loading. Consider temporarily disabling the policy to confirm if it resolves the issue.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
