This situation is likely caused by increased workload or insufficient resource allocation. As a result, all workloads running on this cluster are affected, leading to degraded performance, increased latency, and potential service outages.\n\nService: k8s-cluster\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 90.4,\n  \"memory_percent\": 95.79,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 408.56,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 592.97\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up resources for the k8s-cluster or optimize workloads to reduce resource consumption. Monitor resource usage closely to prevent recurrence.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
