      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in cdn (us-east-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the CDN service in the us-east-1 region, characterized by high resource utilization. Current metrics indicate CPU usage at 90.95%, memory usage at 96.52%, disk I/O at 349.4 Mbps, and network I/O at 965.39 Mbps. This issue is likely due to increased traffic or insufficient resource allocation, affecting all users relying on this service. Users may experience degraded performance, including slow content delivery and increased latency. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: cdn\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 90.95,\n  \"memory_percent\": 96.52,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 349.4,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 965.39\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up resources or optimize current resource usage to handle the load. Investigate traffic patterns for anomalies.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
