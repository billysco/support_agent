      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical frontend issue in admin-dashboard (us-east-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe admin-dashboard service in the us-east-1 region is experiencing critical performance degradation, with a frontend load time of 6258.06 ms. This issue is recurring and is likely caused by inefficient code execution or resource loading problems. Users may face slow page loads, leading to frustration and potential abandonment of the dashboard. The bundle size is 384.9 KB, with 36 resources loaded, indicating possible areas for optimization.\n\nService: admin-dashboard\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 6258.06,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 384.9,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 36\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the frontend code for performance bottlenecks, optimize resource loading, and consider implementing lazy loading for non-critical resources. Customer notification is required due to the impact on user experience.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
