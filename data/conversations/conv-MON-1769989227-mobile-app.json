      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical frontend issue in mobile-app (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe mobile application in the ap-northeast-1 region is experiencing critical performance issues characterized by a high load time of 6139.11 ms and multiple recent errors. The root cause is suspected to be inefficient code or server-side delays affecting resource loading and JavaScript execution. Customers are facing slow page loads, which can lead to frustration and decreased engagement. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: mobile-app\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 6139.11,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 725.72,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 46\n}\n\nWorkaround: As a temporary measure, users can try clearing the app cache or restarting the app to improve performance. However, a thorough investigation of the codebase, particularly the fetchUser function and resource loading mechanisms, is recommended for a permanent fix.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
