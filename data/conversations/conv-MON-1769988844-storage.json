      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in storage (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the storage service within the ap-southeast-1 region. High resource utilization has been observed, with CPU usage at 91.95% and memory usage at 97.14%. This is likely due to insufficient infrastructure capacity or unexpected workload spikes. As a result, customers may experience slow response times, increased latency, or service outages. This issue is recurring and affects all operations relying on the storage service.\n\nService: storage\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 91.95,\n  \"memory_percent\": 97.14,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 324.24,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 300.08\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up infrastructure resources or optimize workload distribution to reduce CPU and memory usage.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
