      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in load-balancer (us-east-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected with the load balancer service in the us-east-1 region. The load balancer is experiencing high resource utilization, with CPU usage at 94.97% and memory usage at 95.45%. This is likely due to increased traffic or insufficient resource allocation. As a result, all applications relying on this load balancer may face performance degradation, leading to increased latency or service interruptions for customers. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: load-balancer\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 94.97,\n  \"memory_percent\": 95.45,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 342.5,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 716.39\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up the load balancer resources to alleviate high CPU and memory usage. Additionally, investigate traffic patterns to determine if load balancing configurations need adjustment. Customer notification is required due to potential service impact.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
