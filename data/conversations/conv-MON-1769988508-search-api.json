      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in search-api (us-west-2)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe search-api in the us-west-2 region is experiencing critical backend failures, specifically affecting the authentication endpoint (/api/v1/auth/login). This issue is likely due to overload or a bug in the authentication service, as indicated by the recurring 500 status code. As a result, customers are unable to log in to the application, which may lead to loss of access to services and decreased user satisfaction.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 704.83,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 0.78\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there are no known workarounds. It is recommended to investigate the backend services for the /api/v1/auth/login endpoint, check for resource bottlenecks, and review recent code changes or deployments that may have introduced bugs.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
