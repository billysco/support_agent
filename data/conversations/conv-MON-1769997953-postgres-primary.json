      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-primary (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the postgres-primary database service located in the ap-southeast-1 region. The DELETE query on the sessions table is taking longer than expected (451.68 ms) due to a high number of affected rows (839). This indicates potential problems with indexing or a large volume of expired sessions. The issue is recurring and impacts session management, leading to delays in user authentication and session handling. Users may experience timeouts or degraded performance while interacting with the application.\n\nService: postgres-primary\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 451.68,\n  \"rows_affected\": 839,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 48\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the database indexing strategy for the sessions table. Optimize the DELETE query and monitor database performance. Consider scaling the connection pool if necessary.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
