      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in auth-api (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe auth-api service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing a critical issue with the /api/v1/search endpoint, resulting in a 500 status code. This indicates an internal server error, likely due to a bug in the code or a failure in a dependent service. As a result, customers are unable to retrieve search results, leading to potential service disruption and dissatisfaction. The issue is recurring, and it is crucial to investigate the auth-api logs for errors around the timestamp to identify the root cause.\n\nService: auth-api\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 744.66,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 36.04\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there is no workaround available. It is recommended to investigate the auth-api logs for errors and consider rolling back recent changes or deploying a fix if a bug is identified.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
