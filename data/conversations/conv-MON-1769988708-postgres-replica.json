      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-replica (us-east-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe postgres-replica service in the us-east-1 region is experiencing critical performance degradation due to high query execution times for UPDATE operations. The root cause is hypothesized to be increased load on the database or inefficient query execution plans, possibly worsened by contention in the connection pool. This issue affects the ability to efficiently update order statuses, leading to potential delays for customers, which may result in confusion and dissatisfaction. The query execution time recorded is 469.33 ms, with 198 rows affected and a connection pool size of 46. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: postgres-replica\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 469.33,\n  \"rows_affected\": 198,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 46\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate database performance metrics, optimize the query execution plan for the UPDATE operation, and consider increasing the connection pool size if necessary. Monitor for further anomalies.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
