      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in k8s-cluster (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the k8s-cluster located in the ap-southeast-1 region. The analysis indicates high resource utilization, with CPU at 93.73% and memory at 95.84%. This is likely due to insufficient resource allocation or a sudden spike in workloads. The performance and stability of the Kubernetes cluster are affected, which may lead to potential downtime or degraded performance of all deployed applications, resulting in slow response times or unavailability.\n\nService: k8s-cluster\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 93.73,\n  \"memory_percent\": 95.84,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 418.37,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 718.52\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up resources for the k8s-cluster or optimize workloads to reduce resource consumption. Monitor for further spikes.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
