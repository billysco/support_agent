This issue is likely caused by a database query timeout or an exception in the code handling the request. As a result, customers attempting to retrieve product data will encounter failures, leading to potential loss of functionality and user dissatisfaction. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: user-api\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 519.66,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 5.85\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the logs for the user-api service to identify the root cause of the 500 error. Check the database performance and ensure that all dependencies are functioning correctly. Consider implementing retries or fallbacks for the affected endpoint.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
