This issue is causing blocked frames during page load, significantly impacting user experience and functionality. Users are experiencing delayed page loads (average load time of 7488.48 ms) and errors, leading to potential frustration and abandonment of the app. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: mobile-app\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 7488.48,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 313.47,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 45\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate CORS policies to ensure that all necessary origins are allowed. Review recent changes to the mobile-app that may have introduced these security errors.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
