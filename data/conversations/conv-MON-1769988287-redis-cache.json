      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in redis-cache (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe redis-cache service in the ap-northeast-1 region is experiencing critical delays in executing DELETE operations on the sessions table. The DELETE query is taking an average of 330.46 ms and is affecting 221 rows, indicating potential issues with database indexing or a high volume of expired sessions. This delay may lead to slower response times for customers, particularly in session management functionalities, resulting in potential timeouts and a degraded user experience. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: redis-cache\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 330.46,\n  \"rows_affected\": 221,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 48\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate and optimize the database indexing on the sessions table. Implement a scheduled job to clean up expired sessions in smaller batches to minimize load during peak times.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
