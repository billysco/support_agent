      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in redis-cache (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe redis-cache service in the ap-northeast-1 region is experiencing critical performance degradation, particularly during audit log insert operations. Analysis indicates a high query execution time of 480.45 ms for the INSERT operation, with 471 rows affected. This may be due to contention in the connection pool or inefficient query execution. The issue is recurring and impacts customers by causing delays in operations that rely on the audit log, potentially affecting application responsiveness and user experience.\n\nService: redis-cache\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 480.45,\n  \"rows_affected\": 471,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 49\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the database performance, optimize the INSERT query, and consider increasing the connection pool size or implementing connection pooling strategies.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
