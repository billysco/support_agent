      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in user-api (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe user-api service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing critical backend issues, likely due to high load or database connectivity problems. This has resulted in 503 Service Unavailable errors, specifically affecting the /api/v1/auth/login endpoint, which is essential for user authentication. As a result, customers are unable to log in, leading to potential frustration and loss of user engagement. The issue is recurring, indicating a need for immediate attention.\n\nService: user-api\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 501.61,\n  \"status_code\": 503,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 29.7\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there is no direct workaround for users to log in. However, backend teams should investigate service health, check database connectivity and performance, and consider scaling resources. Implementing rate limiting may also help if high traffic is detected.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
