Current metrics indicate CPU usage at 91.36% and memory usage at 97.41%, which suggests that the infrastructure is either under-provisioned for the current traffic levels or unable to scale effectively. Customers may experience slow response times and potential service outages as a result of resource exhaustion.\n\nService: cdn\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 91.36,\n  \"memory_percent\": 97.41,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 453.6,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 806.33\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up infrastructure resources or optimize current resource usage to alleviate high CPU and memory utilization.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
