      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in storage (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the storage service located in the ap-northeast-1 region. The analysis indicates high resource utilization with CPU at 93.68%, memory at 95.89%, disk I/O at 486.98 Mbps, and network I/O at 780.22 Mbps. This high utilization is likely due to increased load or inefficient resource allocation, affecting all operations relying on the storage service. Customers may experience degraded performance, increased latency, or service interruptions as a result of these resource constraints.\n\nService: storage\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 93.68,\n  \"memory_percent\": 95.89,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 486.98,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 780.22\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the cause of high resource utilization and optimize resource allocation. Consider scaling the infrastructure to handle the increased load. No immediate workaround is available to mitigate the impact.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
