      "content": "Hi Bill,\n\nI understand that your API is running very slowly and experiencing intermittent outages. I can see how frustrating this must be for you, especially given the impact on your operations. Our engineering team is already aware of this issue and is actively investigating it.\n\nTo assist you better, could you please provide the following details?\n1. The environment you are using (e.g., production, staging).\n2. The region where you are experiencing these issues.\n3. Any specific actions you were trying to perform when you noticed the slowness and outages.\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide a more targeted response. In the meantime, we will keep you updated on our progress every 2 hours until the issue is resolved, as this is classified as a critical bug [KB:bug_reporting#update-frequency].\n\nThank you for your patience as we work to resolve this matter.",
