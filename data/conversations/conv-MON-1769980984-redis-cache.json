      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in redis-cache (eu-west-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe redis-cache service in the eu-west-1 region is experiencing critical resource constraints due to high CPU (93.67%) and memory (97.68%) utilization. This is likely caused by a surge in database queries, leading to performance degradation. Customers may experience increased latency and errors (500 status codes) when accessing the API, potentially resulting in service outages.\n\nService: redis-cache\nRegion: eu-west-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 93.67,\n  \"memory_percent\": 97.68,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 233.3,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 471.71\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up the redis-cache service resources and investigate the database query patterns to optimize performance. Consider implementing rate limiting on API calls to reduce load.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
