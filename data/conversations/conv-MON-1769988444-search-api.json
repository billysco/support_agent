This affects endpoints related to order and product retrieval, leading to customer inability to access order-related functionalities, which may cause loss of sales and user dissatisfaction. The issue is recurring, indicating a persistent problem that needs addressing.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 662.94,\n  \"status_code\": 503,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 8.15\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate backend services and database performance. Consider scaling the search-api service or adjusting rate limiting to manage increased load. No immediate workaround is available for customers.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
