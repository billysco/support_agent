      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical frontend issue in admin-dashboard (us-west-2)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe admin-dashboard service in the us-west-2 region is experiencing critical performance issues due to high load times averaging 5172.71 ms. This is likely caused by an increased bundle size of 213.9 KB and the loading of 18 resources, which exceeds acceptable thresholds. The degraded performance is affecting user experience, leading to potential frustration and abandonment of the dashboard. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: admin-dashboard\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 5172.71,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 213.9,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 18\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate recent changes in bundle size and resource loading. Optimize frontend assets by reducing bundle size and implementing lazy loading for resources to improve performance.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
