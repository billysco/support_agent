This issue is likely caused by performance bottlenecks in the web application, potentially related to inefficient code or resource loading. Customers may experience slow page loads, leading to frustration and potential loss of engagement. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: web-app\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 6463.93,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 371.18,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 30\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the web application for performance bottlenecks, optimize resource loading, and consider increasing server capacity or optimizing backend queries. Notify customers about the ongoing issues to manage expectations.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
