      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-replica (us-east-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe postgres-replica service in the us-east-1 region is experiencing critical performance issues due to high query execution times for UPDATE operations. The root cause is hypothesized to be database contention or inefficient indexing, leading to slow query performance. This issue affects order status updates and overall application responsiveness, potentially causing customer dissatisfaction and increased support inquiries. The query time recorded is 347.71 ms with 403 rows affected, and the connection pool size is 45. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: postgres-replica\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 347.71,\n  \"rows_affected\": 403,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 45\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate database performance metrics, optimize the UPDATE query, and consider adding or modifying indexes to improve execution time.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
