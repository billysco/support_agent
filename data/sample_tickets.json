    "body": "Hi Support Team,\n\nI just reviewed our January invoice (INV-2024-1234) and noticed an unexpected charge of $847.50 labeled as \"API Overage Charges\".\n\nAccording to my understanding of our Professional plan, we should have 100,000 API calls included, and our dashboard shows we only used approximately 85,000 calls last month.\n\nCan you please explain:\n1. Why we were charged for overages when we didn't exceed our limit?\n2. Provide a detailed breakdown of the usage that led to this charge?\n3. If this is an error, how do we get a refund or credit?\n\nI've attached a screenshot of our usage dashboard showing 85,247 calls for the billing period.\n\nThis is the second time we've had billing discrepancies in the past 6 months, so I'd appreciate a thorough review.\n\nThanks,\nMichael",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nI've discovered a bug in the webhook payload structure when testing in our staging environment.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Configure a webhook endpoint in the dashboard\n2. Trigger an event that should fire the webhook (I used 'user.created')\n3. Inspect the received payload\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe webhook payload should include a 'timestamp' field as documented in your API docs (https://docs.example.com/webhooks#payload-structure)\n\nActual behavior:\nThe 'timestamp' field is missing from the payload. All other fields are present.\n\nExample received payload:\n{\n  \"event\": \"user.created\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"user_id\": \"usr_123\",\n    \"email\": \"test@example.com\"\n  }\n}\n\nExpected payload (per docs):\n{\n  \"event\": \"user.created\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-15T16:25:00Z\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"user_id\": \"usr_123\",\n    \"email\": \"test@example.com\"\n  }\n}\n\nEnvironment: Staging\nAPI Version: v2\nWebhook endpoint: https://staging.devshop.dev/webhooks/receiver\n\nThis isn't blocking us since we're still in development, but we'd like to know if this is a known issue and when it might be fixed.\n\nThanks!",
