      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in cdn (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe CDN service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing critical issues due to high resource utilization, with CPU usage at 94.03% and memory usage at 95.86%. This is likely caused by increased traffic or inefficient resource allocation. Customers may face increased latency and potential service disruptions as a result of high CPU and memory usage. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: cdn\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 94.03,\n  \"memory_percent\": 95.86,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 119.25,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 992.37\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up infrastructure resources and investigate traffic patterns to determine if load balancing is needed. Monitor the service closely for any further issues.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
