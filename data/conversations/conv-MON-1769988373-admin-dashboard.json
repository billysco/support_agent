      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical frontend issue in admin-dashboard (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the admin-dashboard service located in the ap-northeast-1 region. The issue is characterized by a page load error likely caused by cross-origin frame blocking due to security policies (CORS). This prevents the admin dashboard from loading necessary resources, leading to potential downtime or degraded performance for users accessing the dashboard. The issue is recurring and affects customers who may experience errors when trying to load the page, resulting in frustration and potential loss of productivity.\n\nService: admin-dashboard\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 7234.93,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 247.99,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 35\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the CORS policy settings and ensure that the necessary origins are allowed. Review recent changes to the admin dashboard that may have introduced this issue.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
