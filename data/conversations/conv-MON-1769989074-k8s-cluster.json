      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in k8s-cluster (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe k8s-cluster in the ap-northeast-1 region is experiencing critical resource constraints due to high resource utilization, with CPU usage at 93.19% and memory usage at 95.76%. This is likely caused by increased workload or insufficient resource allocation. All deployed applications and services within the cluster are affected, leading to potential degraded performance, increased latency, or service outages for customers. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: k8s-cluster\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 93.19,\n  \"memory_percent\": 95.76,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 491.58,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 613.53\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up the k8s-cluster resources (CPU and memory) and investigate workload patterns to optimize resource usage. Notify customers about potential service impacts.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
