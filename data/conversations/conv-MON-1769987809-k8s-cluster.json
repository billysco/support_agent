      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in k8s-cluster (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical infrastructure issue has been detected in the k8s-cluster located in the ap-northeast-1 region. The cluster is experiencing high resource utilization, with CPU at 91.05% and memory at 97.99%. This is likely due to insufficient resource allocation or a sudden spike in workload. The performance of the Kubernetes cluster is affected, which may lead to degraded performance, increased latency, or service outages for all deployed applications and services within the cluster. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: k8s-cluster\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 91.05,\n  \"memory_percent\": 97.99,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 356.45,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 331.69\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up resources for the k8s-cluster or optimize workloads to reduce resource consumption. Monitor for further spikes and consider implementing auto-scaling. Customer notification is required due to potential impact.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
