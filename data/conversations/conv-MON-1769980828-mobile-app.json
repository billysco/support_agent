      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in mobile-app (us-west-2)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe mobile application service in the us-west-2 region is experiencing critical performance degradation and potential outages due to high resource utilization. Current metrics indicate CPU usage at 91.33% and memory usage at 97.4%, suggesting saturation of resources. This issue is recurring and is likely caused by increased load or inefficient resource management. Customers may face slow response times, increased error rates, and potential service outages, negatively impacting user experience.\n\nService: mobile-app\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 91.33,\n  \"memory_percent\": 97.4,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 89.32,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 487.91\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up resources or optimize application performance to reduce CPU and memory usage. Investigate recent traffic patterns and application code for inefficiencies.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
