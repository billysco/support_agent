This is likely caused by unhandled exceptions or resource exhaustion, as indicated by a high latency of 501.97 ms. The issue is recurring and prevents customers from accessing user-related functionalities, leading to potential service loss and user dissatisfaction.\n\nService: user-api\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 501.97,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 24.69\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate server logs for unhandled exceptions, check resource utilization (CPU, memory), and consider scaling the service or optimizing the endpoint logic.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
