      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical frontend issue in admin-dashboard (us-east-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe admin-dashboard service in the us-east-1 region is experiencing critical performance issues, with a high load time of 6688.4ms. This indicates potential inefficiencies in resource loading or delays in backend services. Users are facing slow loading times and intermittent failures, which can lead to frustration and decreased productivity. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: admin-dashboard\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 6688.4,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 475.38,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 42\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there are no effective workarounds. It is recommended to investigate the performance bottlenecks in the frontend code and backend services, optimize resource loading, and review network configurations.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
