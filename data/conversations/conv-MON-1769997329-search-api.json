      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in search-api (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe search-api service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing critical service unavailability, specifically affecting the /api/v1/auth/login endpoint. This issue is indicated by a 503 status code, suggesting backend service overload or dependency failure. All users attempting to authenticate are impacted, preventing access to the application and potentially leading to user dissatisfaction and loss.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 794.05,\n  \"status_code\": 503,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 43.56\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there is no workaround available. It is recommended to investigate the health of backend services and dependencies for the search-api. Scaling resources may be necessary, and reviewing logs for errors related to the 503 status code is advised.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
