The cluster is experiencing high resource utilization, with CPU usage at 91.57% and memory usage at 95.12%. This issue is affecting all workloads running on the cluster, leading to slow response times, application timeouts, and overall degraded performance of services. The root cause is hypothesized to be either an increased workload or insufficient resource allocation. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: k8s-cluster\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 91.57,\n  \"memory_percent\": 95.12,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 384.51,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 390.17\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up the cluster resources or optimize workloads to reduce CPU and memory usage. Investigate recent deployments or changes that may have increased load.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
