      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in auth-api (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe auth-api service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing critical issues, likely due to an overload or failures in backend dependencies. This has resulted in 503 errors and high latency (average latency of 758.79 ms) for the endpoints /api/v1/orders and /api/v1/search. All users accessing these endpoints are affected, leading to an inability to place orders or search for items, which may result in loss of sales and increased user frustration. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: auth-api\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 758.79,\n  \"status_code\": 503,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 24.96\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there are no effective workarounds. It is recommended to investigate backend services for failures or performance issues, scale resources if necessary, and review recent deployments or changes that may have affected service stability.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
