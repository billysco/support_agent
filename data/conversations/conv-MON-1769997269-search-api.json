This failure is likely due to an unhandled exception or a dependency failure, causing customers to be unable to complete payment transactions. The issue is recurring and poses a significant risk of revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 583.58,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 21.12\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there is no known workaround. It is recommended to investigate application logs for the search-api to identify the root cause of the error and implement necessary fixes. Additionally, consider increasing monitoring on dependent services and databases.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
