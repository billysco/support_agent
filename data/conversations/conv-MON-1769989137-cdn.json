      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in cdn (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the CDN service within the ap-southeast-1 region. The service is experiencing high resource utilization, with CPU usage at 93.56%, memory usage at 96.96%, disk I/O at 445.71 Mbps, and network I/O at 528.39 Mbps. This is likely due to increased traffic or insufficient resource allocation. The affected scope includes overall performance and responsiveness of the CDN service, leading to potential degraded performance, increased latency, and possible service outages for customers. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: cdn\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 93.56,\n  \"memory_percent\": 96.96,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 445.71,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 528.39\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up resources or optimize current resource usage to handle the load. Investigate traffic patterns to identify spikes.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
