      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in storage (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical infrastructure issue has been detected in the storage service within the ap-southeast-1 region. The analysis indicates high resource utilization, with CPU usage at 90.91% and memory usage at 97.78%. This is likely due to an increased workload or insufficient resource allocation. All operations dependent on the storage service are affected, leading to potential service degradation, increased latency, or outages for customers. This issue is not recurring but requires immediate attention.\n\nService: storage\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 90.91,\n  \"memory_percent\": 97.78,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 312.98,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 898.51\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up resources or optimize workloads to reduce CPU and memory usage. Monitor for further anomalies.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
