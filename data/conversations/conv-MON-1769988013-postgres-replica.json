      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-replica (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe postgres-replica service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing critical performance degradation. Analysis indicates that the query execution time for retrieving user data is significantly high, with a recorded average of 447.19 ms. This issue is likely due to inefficient indexing on the 'users' table or high load on the database replica. As a result, customers may experience delays in user-related queries, leading to slower application performance and potential timeouts. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: postgres-replica\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 447.19,\n  \"rows_affected\": 960,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 47\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate query performance, optimize indexing on the 'users' table, and monitor the load on the database replica. Consider scaling the database resources if necessary. Customer notification is recommended due to the impact on application performance.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
