This issue is likely caused by database contention or inefficient indexing on the sessions collection. As a result, session management functionality is affected, leading to potential delays, session timeouts, or loss of user state for customers. The average query execution time is 492.45 ms, with 633 rows affected and a connection pool size of 49.\n\nService: mongo-db\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 492.45,\n  \"rows_affected\": 633,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 49\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate database performance metrics, optimize the DELETE query, and review indexing strategies. Consider scaling the database resources if contention is identified.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
