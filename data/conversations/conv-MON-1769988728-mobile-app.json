The ChunkLoadError indicates a failure in loading a specific JavaScript chunk, likely due to a network issue or a misconfiguration in the build process. Users are experiencing significant delays or failures when loading the mobile app, leading to a poor user experience and potential loss of engagement. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: mobile-app\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 7426.75,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 284.48,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 40\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the build process for the mobile app to ensure all chunks are correctly generated and accessible. Check network configurations and CDN settings to ensure proper delivery of resources.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
