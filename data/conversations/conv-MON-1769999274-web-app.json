The ChunkLoadError indicates a failure in loading a specific JavaScript chunk, likely due to a network issue or a misconfiguration in the asset delivery system (e.g., CDN). This affects the web application frontend, leading to potential downtime or degraded performance for users. Customers are experiencing significant delays in page loading, which may result in frustration and abandonment of the application. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: web-app\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 7439.7,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 505.94,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 25\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the asset delivery configuration and network reliability. Implement fallback mechanisms for chunk loading and monitor CDN performance.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
