      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical frontend issue in web-app (us-west-2)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the web application (SERVICE: web-app) affecting users in the us-west-2 region. The frontend load time has exceeded acceptable thresholds, recorded at 5316.08 ms, likely due to resource loading issues or a large bundle size of 281.44 KB with 25 resources loaded. This has led to degraded performance, particularly impacting customer cust_00066. Users may experience slow page loads, resulting in frustration and potential abandonment of the application. The issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: web-app\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 5316.08,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 281.44,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 25\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate and optimize the web application's resource loading and bundle size. Implement lazy loading or code splitting to improve load times. No immediate workaround is available for affected customers.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
