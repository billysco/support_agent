      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in k8s-cluster (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the k8s-cluster service in the ap-southeast-1 region. High resource utilization has been observed, with CPU usage at 94.19% and memory usage at 97.97%. This indicates potential over-provisioning or insufficient resource allocation, likely due to increased load or inefficient workloads. The entire k8s-cluster service is affected, leading to potential service degradation, including degraded performance, increased latency, or service interruptions for customers.\n\nService: k8s-cluster\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 94.19,\n  \"memory_percent\": 97.97,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 153.76,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 100.51\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate workloads running on the cluster, optimize resource allocation, and consider scaling the cluster or redistributing workloads to alleviate resource pressure.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
