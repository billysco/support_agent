      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical frontend issue in mobile-app (us-west-2)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the mobile application frontend for users in the us-west-2 region. The frontend code is attempting to access a property of an undefined object, likely due to a race condition or missing data from an API response. This results in page load errors, significantly degrading the user experience and potentially causing a loss of engagement. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: mobile-app\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 7387.62,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 319.67,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 48\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there is no direct workaround available. It is recommended to investigate the API response handling in the frontend code to ensure proper data validation before access. Additionally, review recent changes to the codebase that may have introduced this issue.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
