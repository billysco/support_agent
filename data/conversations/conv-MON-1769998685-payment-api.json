This is likely due to an unhandled exception or resource exhaustion. The issue is recurring, leading to significant customer impact as users are unable to perform searches, which may result in lost transactions and a degraded user experience.\n\nService: payment-api\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 551.92,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 0.74\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate server logs for the payment-api to identify the root cause of the 500 error. Consider increasing resources or optimizing code to handle requests more efficiently. No immediate workaround is available for customers.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
