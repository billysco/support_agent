      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in search-api (eu-west-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe search-api service in the eu-west-1 region is experiencing a critical issue due to a high volume of requests, resulting in 429 status codes at the /api/v1/products endpoint. This indicates that the request rate has exceeded the allowed limit, preventing customers from accessing product information. The latency is measured at 527.33 ms, which may contribute to the issue. This problem is recurring and affects customer access, potentially leading to loss of sales and dissatisfaction.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: eu-west-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 527.33,\n  \"status_code\": 429,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 9.08\n}\n\nWorkaround: Implement rate limiting adjustments or increase API capacity to handle higher request volumes. Additionally, review and optimize backend processes to reduce latency.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
