      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in load-balancer (us-east-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected with the load balancer service in the us-east-1 region. The load balancer is experiencing resource exhaustion due to high traffic or inefficient resource allocation, resulting in CPU utilization at 92.92% and memory utilization at 95.01%. This may lead to increased latency or downtime for applications relying on the load balancer for traffic distribution, potentially causing service disruptions. The issue is not recurring but requires immediate attention.\n\nService: load-balancer\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 92.92,\n  \"memory_percent\": 95.01,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 499.4,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 222.03\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up the load balancer resources or optimize traffic distribution. Monitor the service closely for further anomalies.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
