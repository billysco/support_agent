      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-replica (eu-west-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe Postgres replica service in the eu-west-1 region is experiencing critical performance issues due to high query execution times, currently averaging 330.16 ms. This is likely caused by database contention or an inefficient query execution plan, affecting the performance of product-related queries. The issue is recurring and has a significant impact on user experience, leading to increased latency for users accessing product information, which may affect sales. A total of 707 rows were affected, and the connection pool size is currently set to 47.\n\nService: postgres-replica\nRegion: eu-west-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 330.16,\n  \"rows_affected\": 707,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 47\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate database performance metrics, optimize the query execution plan, and consider scaling the database resources or connection pool. Customer notification is required due to the impact on user experience.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
