      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in user-api (us-east-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe user-api service in the us-east-1 region is experiencing critical issues with the /api/v1/products endpoint. The endpoint is returning 500 status codes, indicating server errors, and is associated with high latency (534.91 ms). This issue affects all users attempting to access product information, leading to potential frustration and loss of sales. The problem appears to be recurring, likely due to backend service failures or database query issues.\n\nService: user-api\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 534.91,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 49.91\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there are no effective workarounds. It is recommended to investigate backend service logs and database performance metrics to identify the root cause of the 500 errors. Implementing rate limiting or scaling solutions may help manage increased load.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
