Metrics indicate CPU usage at 91.02%, memory usage at 97.42%, disk I/O at 436.75 MBps, and network I/O at 698.59 MBps. This issue is recurring and may lead to degraded performance for customers, including increased latency and potential service interruptions when accessing storage resources.\n\nService: storage\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 91.02,\n  \"memory_percent\": 97.42,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 436.75,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 698.59\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up the storage service resources and investigate load patterns to identify spikes or trends that may require further optimization.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
