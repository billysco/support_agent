The analysis indicates a high load time of 5121.03 ms, which may be attributed to a large bundle size of 674.85 kb and inefficient resource loading. This issue affects the performance for users in this region, particularly impacting customer cust_00094. Customers may experience slow page loads, leading to frustration and potential abandonment of the application. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: web-app\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 5121.03,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 674.85,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 36\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate and optimize the frontend bundle size and resource loading strategy. Consider implementing lazy loading for resources and reviewing server response times. Customer notification is required.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
