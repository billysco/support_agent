This issue is likely caused by a backend failure due to service overload or a bug in the codebase. As a result, customers are unable to access user data, leading to potential loss of functionality and dissatisfaction. The issue is recurring, indicating a persistent problem that needs immediate attention.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: eu-west-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 737.24,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 16.08\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there are no effective workarounds. It is recommended to investigate backend service logs for errors, check for recent deployments or changes, and consider scaling resources or optimizing the code to handle increased load.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
