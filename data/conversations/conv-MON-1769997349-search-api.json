      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in search-api (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe search-api service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing a critical issue characterized by a high error rate, specifically 503 status codes. This indicates that the service is unavailable, likely due to backend service unavailability or resource exhaustion. The affected endpoints include /api/v1/users, /api/v1/auth/login, and /api/v1/payments, resulting in significant service disruptions. Customers are unable to access user-related functionalities, log in, or process payments, leading to a poor user experience and potential loss of transactions. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 542.75,\n  \"status_code\": 503,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 38.45\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the health and resource utilization of the backend services. Scale resources as necessary and review any recent changes or deployments that may have contributed to the instability. Customer notification is recommended due to the impact on service availability.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
