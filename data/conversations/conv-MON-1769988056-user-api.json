This issue is likely caused by a backend service failure or database connectivity problem. As a result, users are unable to authenticate or perform searches, leading to a degraded experience and potential loss of trust. The issue is recurring, indicating a persistent problem that needs immediate attention.\n\nService: user-api\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 697.46,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 36.63\n}\n\nWorkaround: No specific workaround is available. It is recommended to investigate backend service logs and database connectivity. Consider scaling resources or optimizing queries if necessary.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
