      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-replica (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe postgres-replica service in the ap-northeast-1 region is experiencing critical performance degradation. A DELETE query on the sessions table is taking longer than expected, affecting 741 rows. This delay is likely due to inefficient indexing or a high volume of expired sessions. As a result, customers may face increased latency in session management operations, leading to potential timeouts and a degraded user experience. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: postgres-replica\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 463.99,\n  \"rows_affected\": 741,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 45\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate and optimize the indexing on the sessions table. Implement a batch deletion strategy for expired sessions to reduce the load on the database. Monitor query performance and connection pool usage closely.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
