      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-replica (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe postgres-replica service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing critical performance degradation. A DELETE query on the sessions table is taking longer than expected, with a query time of 326.54 ms and affecting 28 rows. This issue is likely due to a large number of expired sessions or database contention. The degraded performance impacts session management, leading to increased latency for users, which may result in slower response times and potential timeouts. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: postgres-replica\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 326.54,\n  \"rows_affected\": 28,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 47\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate database performance, optimize the DELETE query, and consider indexing the 'expires_at' column to improve efficiency. Monitor connection pool usage to ensure it is not contributing to latency.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
