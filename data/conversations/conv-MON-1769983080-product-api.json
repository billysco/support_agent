      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in product-api (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe product-api service in the ap-northeast-1 region is experiencing critical issues due to high resource utilization, with CPU usage at 94.84% and memory usage at 96.33%. This is likely caused by increased traffic or inefficient resource allocation. Customers may face increased latency and potential service unavailability as a result of high CPU and memory usage. The issue is recurring, indicating a persistent problem that needs to be addressed.\n\nService: product-api\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 94.84,\n  \"memory_percent\": 96.33,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 313.24,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 873.0\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up resources for the product-api service and investigate traffic patterns or optimize code to reduce resource consumption. Customer notification is required due to the potential impact on service availability.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
