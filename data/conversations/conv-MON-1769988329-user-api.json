      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in user-api (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe user-api service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing a critical issue where the /api/v1/search endpoint is returning a 500 Internal Server Error. This is likely due to a failure in handling requests, potentially linked to database query performance or service misconfiguration. As a result, all users attempting to perform searches via this API are affected, leading to a loss of functionality and user dissatisfaction. The issue is recurring, indicating a persistent problem that requires immediate attention.\n\nService: user-api\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 690.83,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 33.03\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there are no effective workarounds. It is recommended to investigate the user-api service logs for errors, analyze database performance, and review recent service configuration changes. Consider implementing rate limiting or scaling to mitigate the impact.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
