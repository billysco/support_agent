      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-primary (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the postgres-primary database service located in the ap-southeast-1 region. The database query execution time has exceeded normal thresholds, currently averaging 484.62 ms, which is impacting the primary PostgreSQL database service responsible for handling product category queries. This may lead to increased latency for all users querying product data, resulting in a degraded user experience and potential loss of sales. The issue is recurring, indicating a persistent problem with either the query execution plan or increased load on the database server.\n\nService: postgres-primary\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 484.62,\n  \"rows_affected\": 286,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 48\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the execution plan for the affected query, optimize indexes on the 'products' table, and monitor database performance metrics for anomalies. If necessary, consider scaling the database resources to handle the load more effectively.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
