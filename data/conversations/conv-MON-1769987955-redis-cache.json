      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in redis-cache (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the redis-cache service in the ap-northeast-1 region. The DELETE query on the sessions table is taking longer than expected (385.67 ms) due to a high number of affected rows (938), which may indicate a lack of proper indexing or an accumulation of expired sessions. This performance degradation specifically impacts session management, potentially leading to increased latency in user sessions and slower application response times. Users may experience delays and possible session timeouts. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: redis-cache\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 385.67,\n  \"rows_affected\": 938,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 45\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the indexing on the sessions table and optimize the DELETE query. Implement a scheduled job to clean up expired sessions in smaller batches to reduce query time.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
