      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in search-api (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe search-api in the ap-northeast-1 region is experiencing a critical issue resulting in 500 Internal Server Errors. This is likely due to a backend failure, potentially caused by high load or a bug in the code. The search functionality for products is impaired, affecting all users attempting to access product data. This issue is recurring and has a significant customer impact, as users are unable to retrieve product information, which may lead to loss of sales and user dissatisfaction. Immediate investigation is required.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 736.76,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 13.92\n}\n\nWorkaround: Currently, there are no effective workarounds. It is recommended to investigate backend service logs for errors, assess server load, and consider scaling resources or optimizing the API code.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
