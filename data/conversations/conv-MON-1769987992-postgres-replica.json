The analysis indicates that high query execution times, specifically for the SELECT COUNT(*) query, are likely due to database contention or an inefficient query execution plan. This issue is recurring and is impacting database query performance, leading to increased latency in application response times, which negatively affects user experience.\n\nService: postgres-replica\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 411.04,\n  \"rows_affected\": 756,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 45\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the query execution plan for the SELECT COUNT(*) query and optimize the database indices. Monitor connection pool usage and consider increasing the pool size if necessary.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
