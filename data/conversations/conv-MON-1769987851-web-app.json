The error 'ReferenceError: fetchUser is not defined' indicates a missing or improperly defined function in the frontend code, likely due to a recent deployment or code change. This issue affects the web application frontend, causing page load failures for users. Customers are experiencing significant delays with an average load time of 5077ms, leading to potential loss of engagement and frustration. This issue is recurring and requires customer notification.\n\nService: web-app\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 5077.09,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 363.93,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 44\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate recent code changes for the web-app service, specifically looking for the definition of the 'fetchUser' function. If necessary, roll back to the last stable version to restore functionality.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
