      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical api issue in user-api (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe user-api service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing critical rate limiting issues, as evidenced by multiple 429 status codes. This indicates that the service is receiving excessive concurrent requests that exceed its capacity. The affected endpoints include search, login, and product retrieval functionalities. As a result, customers are unable to access these critical features, leading to a significantly poor user experience. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: user-api\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 535.86,\n  \"status_code\": 429,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 30.44\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the request patterns to identify peak usage times and consider implementing rate limiting strategies. Additionally, optimizing the API to handle more concurrent requests and reviewing backend performance for potential bottlenecks may alleviate the issue. Customers should be notified of the ongoing issues and potential delays in service.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
