      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-replica (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe postgres-replica service in the ap-southeast-1 region is experiencing critical performance degradation due to high query execution times, which have exceeded acceptable thresholds. This issue is likely caused by database locking or resource contention, potentially worsened by high connection pool usage. As a result, session management operations are affected, leading to delays, timeouts, or login failures for customers. The query execution time recorded was 372.15 ms, with 31 rows affected and a current connection pool size of 45.\n\nService: postgres-replica\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 372.15,\n  \"rows_affected\": 31,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 45\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate and resolve database locking issues, optimize the DELETE query, and monitor connection pool usage. If necessary, consider increasing the connection pool size to alleviate contention.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
