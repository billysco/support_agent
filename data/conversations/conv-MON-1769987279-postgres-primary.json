      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in postgres-primary (ap-southeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the postgres-primary database service located in the ap-southeast-1 region. The analysis indicates high query execution times, with an average of 310.87 ms, likely due to database contention or an inefficient query execution plan. This issue affects the performance of queries on the products table, leading to potential delays in retrieving product counts. As a result, customers may experience degraded user experience and increased bounce rates. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: postgres-primary\nRegion: ap-southeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 310.87,\n  \"rows_affected\": 205,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 48\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the database performance metrics, optimize the query execution plan, and consider adding an index to the 'category' column to enhance query execution times. Additionally, monitor the connection pool size, currently at 48, to ensure it is appropriately configured for workload demands.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
