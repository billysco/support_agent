      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in redis-cache (ap-northeast-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the Redis cache service in the ap-northeast-1 region. The analysis indicates that the DELETE operation on the 'sessions' table is experiencing a high query execution time of 361.29 ms, affecting 550 rows. This is likely due to database locking or inefficient indexing. The performance degradation may lead to delays in session management, resulting in potential timeouts or login failures for users, thereby impacting the overall user experience. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: redis-cache\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 361.29,\n  \"rows_affected\": 550,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 48\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the database indexing and locking mechanisms for the 'sessions' table. Consider optimizing the DELETE query or increasing the connection pool size from 48 if necessary. Customer notification is required due to the potential impact on user experience.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
