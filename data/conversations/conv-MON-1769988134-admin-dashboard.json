      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical frontend issue in admin-dashboard (eu-west-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nThe admin-dashboard service in the eu-west-1 region is experiencing critical performance issues due to frontend load times exceeding acceptable thresholds. The current load time is 7703.71 ms, with a bundle size of 389.06 KB and 28 resources loaded. This has led to degraded user experience, causing frustration and potential abandonment of the dashboard by customers. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: admin-dashboard\nRegion: eu-west-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 7703.71,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 389.06,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 28\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the frontend code for optimization opportunities, analyze resource loading patterns, and consider reducing bundle size. Monitor load times closely for further anomalies.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
