This is likely due to high load or a bug in the order processing logic. The affected scope includes endpoints related to order processing and search functionality. Customers are currently unable to successfully place orders or perform searches, which may lead to revenue loss and dissatisfaction. This issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: eu-west-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 729.57,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 5.4\n}\n\nWorkaround: There are no known workarounds at this time. It is recommended to investigate backend performance issues, check logs for errors, and consider scaling resources or optimizing the order processing logic.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
