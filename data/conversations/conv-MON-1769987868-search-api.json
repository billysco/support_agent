This issue is recurring and affects customers attempting to retrieve user data, potentially disrupting their applications. The latency for requests to this endpoint is measured at 513.95 ms, indicating performance degradation.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 513.95,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 25.67\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the server logs for the search-api to identify the root cause of the 500 error. Address any underlying issues found and consider scaling resources if the problem is related to load. Customers should be notified of the ongoing issue and advised to monitor their applications for disruptions.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
