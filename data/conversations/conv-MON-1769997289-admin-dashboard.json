This has resulted in failed page loads for users, significantly impacting their ability to access the dashboard and potentially disrupting their operations. The average load time is recorded at 6244.36 ms with a bundle size of 512.22 kb, and a total of 30 resources are being loaded.\n\nService: admin-dashboard\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 6244.36,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 512.22,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 30\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate network connectivity issues and backend service health. Optimize frontend load performance and consider scaling resources if necessary.
