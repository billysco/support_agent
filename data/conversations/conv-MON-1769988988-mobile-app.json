The error 'ReferenceError: fetchUser is not defined' suggests that a JavaScript function is either missing or improperly loaded, likely due to a recent code deployment or caching issue. This has resulted in page load failures for users, significantly increasing load times (average: 6555.96 ms) and impacting user engagement.\n\nService: mobile-app\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: frontend\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"load_time_ms\": 6555.96,\n  \"bundle_size_kb\": 308.19,\n  \"resources_loaded\": 12\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate recent code changes related to the 'fetchUser' function. Clear caches and redeploy the application if necessary. Users may temporarily refresh the application to attempt to bypass the issue.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
