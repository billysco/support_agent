      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical infrastructure issue in cdn (us-west-2)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the CDN service within the us-west-2 region. The root cause is hypothesized to be high resource utilization, likely due to increased traffic or inefficient resource allocation. Metrics indicate CPU utilization at 92.58%, memory utilization at 95.19%, disk I/O at 72.5 Mbps, and network I/O at 680.75 Mbps. This issue is impacting content delivery performance, potentially causing delays, increased latency, and a degraded user experience for customers. Customer notification is required.\n\nService: cdn\nRegion: us-west-2\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: infrastructure\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"cpu_percent\": 92.58,\n  \"memory_percent\": 95.19,\n  \"disk_io_mbps\": 72.5,\n  \"network_io_mbps\": 680.75\n}\n\nWorkaround: Scale up infrastructure resources and investigate traffic patterns or application performance issues.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
