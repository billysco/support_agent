This is likely due to backend service failures or resource exhaustion. All customers utilizing this service are affected, resulting in an inability to complete payment transactions, which may lead to loss of sales and customer dissatisfaction. The issue is recurring and requires immediate attention.\n\nService: search-api\nRegion: ap-northeast-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: api\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"latency_ms\": 652.26,\n  \"status_code\": 500,\n  \"request_size_kb\": 46.81\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate the backend services and database connections for the search-api. Increase resource allocation if necessary and implement rate limiting to prevent overload. Review logs for detailed error messages. Customer notification is recommended.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
