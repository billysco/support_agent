      "content": "Subject: Critical issue: Critical database issue in mongo-db (us-east-1)\n\nAutomated detection from monitoring system:\n\nA critical issue has been detected in the mongo-db service located in the us-east-1 region. The query execution time for the 'products' collection is significantly longer than expected, currently averaging 319.49 ms. This is likely due to database contention or inefficient indexing. The performance degradation affects application response times, potentially leading to customer dissatisfaction. The issue is recurring, indicating a persistent problem that requires immediate attention.\n\nService: mongo-db\nRegion: us-east-1\nSeverity: critical\nEvent Type: database\n\nMetrics:\n{\n  \"query_time_ms\": 319.49,\n  \"rows_affected\": 488,\n  \"connection_pool_size\": 45\n}\n\nWorkaround: Investigate and optimize the database indexing on the 'products' collection. Review and optimize the query execution plan to improve performance. If necessary, consider increasing the connection pool size from the current 45 to accommodate higher load.\n\nThis ticket was auto-generated by the AI monitoring system.",
